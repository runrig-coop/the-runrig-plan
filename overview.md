# Overview
## Purpose
In its broadest sense, Runrig is a technology framework for the communal management of the digital assets of a foodshed, as well as networks of cooperating foodsheds. To the degree that such information may control the flow of actual material resources, it may be viewed as a tool for the democratic management of food, labor, land and other resources that such information represents. In today's paradigm of "platform capitalism", technology companies derive their wealth and power by mediating interactions between users and capturing a portion of the value exchanged in the process. That portion only grows over time, even when the platform is no longer needed to mediate such an exchange.[^1] By recognizing this, and reclaiming common ownership of the technologies that mediate relations between farmers, distributors, drivers, wholesalers, retailers, commercial buyers and end consumers, Runrig aspires to nothing less than the total redistribution of that value, giving control of the wealth and power it creates back to the people who created it.

## Three Layers of Autonomy
To understand what Runrig is, we can start by examining what kind of digital assets it is intended to manage. For explanatory purposes, let's separate them into two very broad categories: the data itself, and the software programs that capture, process and generally make use of such data. Free software proponents and privacy advocates have spilt a good deal of ink advancing the argument that true autonomy in computing requires control of both the data and the software, not to mention the hardware the whole system runs on.[^2] [^3] [^4] As the old saying goes: "There is no cloud, just someone else's computer."[^5] Efforts to achieve computational autonomy, however, rarely exceed a vision for _individual_ autonomy, and so are inevitably limited by individual _capabilities_. These solutions generally fall short in one of two ways: either they must curtail the range of functionality users have come to expect from so-called "Software-as-a-Service" (SaaS) platforms; or they foist the burdens of administering and maintaining those systems onto users who lack the capability to do so. As Luis Villa observes, if free software and open source advocates focus too narrowly on licensing and sharing source code, while overlooking the actual capabilities this provides their users, then at best they can only offer _permissive freedom_, not _effective freedom_ — that is, they've granted the user permission, hypothetically, but not the actual capability to use the software freely.[^6]

Runrig differs from other approaches by coordinating the pooled capabilities of a community under democratic and cooperativist principles of governance. This way, ownership and control of both the data and the software can be shared collectively by all participants in a foodshed, while preserving the rights of individual users. To achieve this, Runrig comprises three functional layers:

1. A single, collectively owned data storage provider, or "pod"[^7] provider.
2. Many federated cooperative service platforms.
3. Local-first[^8], end user applications (optional).
<!-- TODO: Is this third layer necessary? -->

### The Data Provider
The first layer is a global commons, providing networked data storage to all its members as a shared service, while diffusing the costs and responsibilities of managing the underlying databases and hosting services such a system entails. This layer corresponds to the data category of digital assets, as outlined above, and should be relatively indifferent to the shape of that data or how it's intended to be used.

This data provider can be thought of as a kind of cloud-based file system, like Dropbox or Google Drive, accessible from anywhere with an Internet connection, but with two key differences. First, it is collectively owned by all its members, not some corporation and its shareholders. So while it may not be each user's private computer, it is still _their computer_ in a very real sense, with full governance rights over the infrastructure hosting their data, in addition to individual protections under the terms of service. Secondly, while it could in fact be used as a file system, it holds even greater potential as a source of structured data, like an SQL database or even more modern low-code databases like Airtable. This gives it the power to integrate more readily with a myriad of existing services via its API.

### Service Platforms
The second layer is a federation of platform cooperatives[^9], which can run the gamut of web-based applications and other software services, like the ones we're all accustomed to today. This layer corresponds to the software category of digital assets. Services might include consumer-facing ecommerce sites or wholesale buying clubs, crop management software and record keeping, logistical and fleet management, bookkeeping, timesharing for certified kitchen space, etc. Also, a platform is not limited to providing a single service, and it can have separate websites set up for each. For example, there may be one site where retail customers place orders and another site where farmers track inventory through a different service. Critically, however, the two systems would still be integrated, sharing infrastructure, operating costs, and a unity of purpose.

Each of these service-oriented platform coops would function best within a geographically contiguous region, or what we loosely call a "foodshed". This way they can curate the services provided on their platform in order to best suit the needs of their members. They can even tailor the configuration and features of specific services as they choose. For example, if a platform wants to add a service for aggregating CSA orders, they can do so easily. If they need a specialized feature for a citrus CSA and one exists, they can enable it. If it doesn't already exist, they can sponsor its development and contribute the open source feature back to the commons. Meanwhile, other platforms could add features for a flower CSA instead, or omit the CSA service entirely. In this way, geographic regions offer a sensible criterion for bounding a platform's scope of functionality, since some services might make sense in one region or climate but not another. It also keeps governance more manageable, when not trying to accommodate the needs of a larger and more dispersed membership. In theory nothing prevents a platform from being as small or large as desired, but each platform will require some combination of time, expertise and money to maintain, so the distribution of those costs should be balanced with the desire for more localized control. Nevertheless, it shouldn't be necessary to impose strict boundaries on any one platform's range of coverage, and users would be free to join more than one platform if available and desirable. It may also prove useful to cover a more dispersed geographic area, for niche sectors of production or distribution, like pasture-raised meats or high-value crops. These are tradeoffs that should be left to the thoughtful deliberation of the constituents of each platform, so they can strike the right balance to meet their own goals given their unique circumstances.

This second layer, regardless of the particular platform or service, is also the layer that users will typically interact with. It will be the service platform's website where most users sign-up for an account, assuming they've been approved for membership in the cooperative that operates and governs that platform. In the same stroke, they will gain membership to the global data provider as well. They will be given a data pod that belongs exclusively to them, designated by a unique address, so that the first layer will also serve as an identity provider, much like an email address. The technical process can remain invisible to the user, but they can feel assured that their data is theirs to control. This is backed up by the fact that they hold a share in the governance of how the data provider stores their data, as well as a share in how any service platform they join is allowed to use it. If at any time they wish to join a different service or leave entirely, they can more easily bring their data along with them, because portability is a fundamental aspect of the design.

Ultimately, the service platforms only mediate the exchange between the data provider and the user, both in terms of the actual data exchange, as well as the service level agreements between all three parties. That is not to say that power users are prevented from interacting directly with the data provider, especially if they have programming knowledge; they just don't _have_ to do so directly. They don't have to be aware how those data transactions work, or that the data provider even exists, although hopefully they will appreciate that regardless of what service platform they use, they retain certain rights over both their data and how the storage of it is administered.

### Local-first Applications
The third layer, applications that individual users can run and store locally on their personal devices, is not strictly necessary, and may only appeal to certain power users, but it emerges quite naturally from the distributed nature of the overall framework, and affords some interesting potentialities for peer-to-peer scenarios. (more on that...)

## Unique Advantages
To be sure, these are grand ambitions, for not just a single technology platform, but an entire ecology of interconnected platforms. Fortunately, there has been a great deal of prior work to establish the standards and infrastructure necessary to make it all possible, and because it takes advantage of free software and collaborative methodologies, there is a lot that can be done merely by snapping together off-the-shelf components.

There are also some unique scaling properties of this model, due to the way the data layer and software layer are treated as separate concerns. While Runrig does not necessarily need to adhere to the Solid protocol in its implementation, it, as described in its [documentation](https://solidproject.org/developers/vocabularies):

> One of the core ideas behind solid is to make __data__ independent from __applications__, so that one can be in control of his/her own data and share it with the apps of his/her choice. For this to be possible, the same piece of data must be understood __consistently__ from one app to another. This requires agreeing on the meaning of the data, as conveyed by its description. Therefore, to make data reusable, it should be described with vocabularies that are widely used and known.

So, as a proof-of-concept, we could provide a simple hosting service for farmers to store their crop plans and production data as it pertains to certain user scenarios. These scenarios will be selected for the purposes of prototyping specific solutions — e.g., surveys to asses whether the farms in a food hub are on target to match anticipated sales volumes — so that we can illustrate the need for such solutions, while simultaneously delivering the applications that meet the most immediate of those needs, and also testing the underlying architecture and services that can support them.

From the very beginning, this data will be conformant with both the [farmOS Data Model](https://farmos.org/model/), as well as the [Solid Protocol](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol), so that even if we're unable to maintain this service long-term, users will have an easy migration path to a farmOS or Solid hosting provider (such as [Farmier](https://farmier.com/) or [Inrupt](https://start.inrupt.com/), respectively).

If, however, we are able to secure the resources and commitment necessary for long-term maintenance and development, then...
