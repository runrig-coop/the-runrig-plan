:::info Summary of Farm Flow's Main Motivations & Purpose

As a software platform, social enterprise, and knowledge ecosystem, Farm Flow
provides a comprehensive solution for crop planning, team management, and
operational analysis, serving farms of all shapes and sizes. A key value
proposition is the Farm Flow Board, a visualization of all the field tasks to be
carried out for every crop on the farm, as well as Standard Operating Procedures
(SOPs) that prescribe how each task is to be performed. With these utilities in
hand, team members can coordinate their activities to achieve targeted
production volumes, desired costs savings, and positive environmental impacts.
As a wider community and a forum for exchanging knowledge, Farm Flow also
connects farmers to agronomists, technicians, designers, and other stakeholders,
activating new channels for collaboration and innovation.
