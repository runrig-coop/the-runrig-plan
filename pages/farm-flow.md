## Overview
Farm Flow is a comprehensive suite of farm management tools, comprising two main
parts: the __Farm Flow Board__ and __Farm Flow SOPs__ (standard operating
procedures). The board is the central visualization, with a sweepingly full view
of the season's crop plan, field actions, and significant weather events. All
the critical data points on the board correspond to criteria and prescriptions
detailed in the SOPs, which are based on a formal data analysis of real-world
organic farming practices and the outcomes they produce. With these utilities in
hand, team members can coordinate their activities to achieve targeted
production volumes, desired costs savings, and positive environmental impacts.
As a wider community and a forum for exchanging knowledge, Farm Flow also
connects farmers to agronomists, technicians, designers, and other stakeholders,
activating new channels for collaboration and innovation.

The system was designed and built by farmers, for farmers, principally Matthew
Fitzgerald of Fitzgerald Organics in Minnesota. The canonical version is a
physical whiteboard, which Matthew has replicated for several other farms in his
region, offering a D.I.Y. Kit to anyone who thinks they may benefit from it.

See the [official Farm Flow website] for the latest updates on the software
project, its current status, and how to sign up to use the application or create
your own physical Farm Flow whiteboard for your farm.
