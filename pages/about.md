# What is Runrig?
Like the home page says,

> Runrig is a communal farming platform, a _libre_ software project, and a
> method for socio-ecological design. It calls for collective sovereignty over
> not just our food, but also the labor that raises it, the land and living
> things that support it, and the data connecting it all.

That's a mouthful that doesn't get much of the real shape and texture of the
thing. The best place to start getting acquainted is [The Runrig Plan], an even
bigger mouthful, but check back soon for some more bite-size summations of what
sorts of actual stuff we've built and what all's changed since this thing got
started way back in 2022.

## Who is Runrig?
Runrig is the product of many conversations with, and direct contributions from,
many comrades between the [GOAT] community, [OpenTEAM], [Skywoman], [DWeb], and
many other spheres of interest.

For the moment, however, Jamie Gaehring is the solo cat-herder (Hi, that's [me]!
&#128075;&#127995;). I hope to change that soon, so check the [get involved]
page for updates on how to join, particularly if you're a tech worker, food
worker, farmer, or activist. I also welcome direct inquiries, constructive
feedback, and other support [via email], if that's your preference.
