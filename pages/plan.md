title: The Runrig Plan
subtitle: A socio-ecological methodology of software development
description: Free and open source software is a starting point, not the
    destination. Full computing autonomy requires control of the underlying
    infrastructure, something beyond the capacity of most individuals.
---

The Runrig Plan is a design methodology for communal software projects. It
emphasizes ecology and social relations rather than any particular technology
stack or software architecture. It was conceived specifically with food systems
and agricultural software in mind, but there's no reason it must be restricted
to that domain.

For now, the best overview is still the original [draft proposal]. The initial
goal was to adapt and expand that proposal into several ["appendices"] each
covering a broad subject matter, but that framework was poorly suited to the
material. In its place, the [Runrig Journal] will offer more organic, piecemeal
illustrations of Runrig's key components, which will then be outlined here and
organized by topic, with links to relevant articles that go into more detail.
Hopefully that will yield quicker entry points into the practical aspects of the
plan, while also giving a clearer birdseye view of the project in its totality.

As much as possible, the Runrig Plan is intended to be an iterative, living
document that incorporates an ever growing range of perspectives. So if you have
any questions, comments, or you'd like to contribute, please don't hesitate to

## Why a New Methodology?
Generally speaking, the purpose of establishing the Runrig Plan as a distinct
methodology can be seen as threefold:

1. The Runrig Plan will form __a general critique of conventional software
   development methodologies__ – e.g., the Agile or Lean paradigms – and how
   they come freighted with the implicit biases of proprietary technology and
   capitalistic modes of production. Those biases are borne out in concepts like
   scalability, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS, a.k.a., "the cloud"), and even
   object-oriented programming (OOP), which in turn come with deeply embedded
   assumptions about infinite growth, [enclosure], and a dualistic view of
   humanity's relationship to nature, respectively. The Runrig Plan aspires to
   create a new set of design primitives and computing metaphors that will
   actively combat those anti-patterns in order to redistribute control over our
   shared technological inheritance more equitably.

2. In a similar respect, it will look at the ways __free & open source software
   ([FOSS]) can transcend the limited scope of _individual_ liberties to
   explicitly _socialize_ the project for software freedom__. This includes
   [radical participatory design] and can go so far as to blur the lines between
   the traditional realms of "user experience" (UX) and "developer experience"
   (DX). It requires leveraging the community's total knowledge and combined
   skills without privileging one form of expertise over another. Our collective
   expertise can be so much more powerful when it is based on mutual trust and a
   shared understanding. By designing for (and with) the [shared capabilities of
   the entire community], design decisions become better contextualized,
   information systems become more deeply integrated, and the tools that we all
   use become more accessible to more people – in other words, they become
   _[convivial tools]_.

3. Finally, through __analysis of Runrig's ongoing work and emerging project
   proposals__, the plan will address what concrete strategies have worked,
   which ones have not, and how to adapt those lessons to serve a broader
   community of farmers, food workers, and technologists. This will be in
   conjunction with – and mostly synthesized from – the [Runrig Journal], an
   ongoing series of blog posts, case studies, tutorials, etc. A key tenet of
   Runrig since its inception has been to prioritize __ecology over
   architecture__. Runrig, as a design methodology, should be understood as a
   _social technology_, first and foremost; whatever digital architectures
   subsequently emerge from that social matrix must then conform to those
   principles. Accordingly, we cannot approach the design of our digital tools
   from a purely theoretical standpoint of mechanistic determinism, but must
   root our theory in an iterative praxis and organic spontaneity.

To wrap up and expand on that last point, I'll paraphrase the [closing section]
of Runrig's original proposal...

Continuous experimentation and free play, _jeu libre_, when practiced throughout
the lifecycle of a project like Runrig, can have tremendous potential that
cannot be overstated. The evolution of a software system is only one factor in
the evolution of the broader social and natural systems in which it is embedded.
Experiments may succeed, or they may fail; _ad hoc_ measures may eventually find
wider adoption as a general solution, or they'll only ever serve a tiny niche of
user scenarios; freely sharing some bit of knowledge or a particular technique
may be recognized and reciprocated, or that datum will merely fade into the
background hum of information and culture. Regardless, each one of these
outcomes will be metabolized within an open system of communal stewardship. The
small lessons and incremental progress each one marks will be contributed back
to the whole, always in one form or another, so that it continues to nurture and
expand the commons.

## Original Documents
The original plan and its appendices have been archived for reference:

- [Runrig: A Plan for Socio-ecological Design]
- [Appendix: Ecology]
- [Appendix: Architecture]

Some material from "Ecology" and "Architecture" will incorporated into newer
articles, such as [Illegible Agriculture]. The archived documents will
eventually be superseded by those updated versions, but the original content
will be preserved and the links should remain stable.
