title: The Runrig Plan
subtitle: A socio-ecological methodology of software development
description: Free and open source software is a starting point, not the
    destination. Full computing autonomy requires control of the underlying
    infrastructure, something beyond the capacity of most individuals.
---

The Runrig Plan is a development methodology for communal software projects with
an emphasis on ecology and social relations, rather than any specific technology
stack or software architecture. It has been designed with software for regional
food systems especially in mind, although it does not have to be restricted to
that domain.

For now, the best overview is still the original [draft proposal for Runrig].
The initial goal was to expand that proposal into several ["appendices"] that
would cover broad topic areas, but that proved impractical to maintain. Instead,
the [Runrig Journal] will hopefully provide a more organic, piecemeal approach
of exploring specific aspects and components of Runrig, which can then be
outlined here and organized by topic or key entry points, to give a birdseye
view of the plan in its totality.

## Why a new methodology?
Generally speaking, the purpose of establishing the Runrig Plan as a distinct methodology can be seen as threefold:

1. The plan is intended as __a general critique of conventional software
  development methodologies__ – e.g., Agile or Lean development – and how they
  often come freighted with the implicit assumptions of proprietary technology
  and capitalistic modes of growth – e.g., concepts like scalability,
  Software-as-a-Service (SaaS, a.k.a, "the cloud"), and even object-oriented
  programming (OOP). The hope is to establish a new set of design primitives and
  computing metaphors that can help to counteract those anti-patterns and more
  fairly redistribute control over our shared technological inheritance.

2. In a similar vein, the plan will look at ways __free & open source software
  ([FOSS]) can transcend the limited scope of _individual_ liberties to
  explicitly _socialize_ the project for software freedom__. This includes
  [radical participatory design] and can go so far as to blur the lines between
  the traditional realms of "user experience" (UX) and "developer experience"
  (DX). It requires leveraging the community's total knowledge and combined
  skills without privileging one form over another, because our collective
  expertise can be so much more powerful when it is based on mutual trust and a
  shared understanding. By designing for (and with) the [shared capabilities of
  the entire community], design decisions become better contextualized,
  information systems become more deeply integrated, and the tools we all use
  become more accessible to more people – or in other words, they become
  _[convivial tools]_.

3. Finally, through __analysis of Runrig's ongoing work and emerging project
  proposals__, the plan will address what concrete strategies have worked, which
  ones have not, and how to adapt those lessons to serve a broader community of
  farmers, food workers, and technologists. This will be in conjunction with –
  and mostly synthesized from – the [Runrig Journal], an ongoing series of blog
  posts, case studies, tutorials, etc. As much as possible, the plan is meant to
  be an iterative, living document that can incorporate an ever wider scope of
  perspectives. so if you have any questions, comments, or you'd like to

## Archived Documents
The original plan's overview and appendices will be archived for reference:

- [Overview]

- [Architecture] (archived)

Some material from "Ecology" and "Architecture" are already being incorporated
into newer articles, such as [Illegible Agriculture]. The archived documents
will eventually be superseded by the updated versions, but the links and
original content will remain stable and be preserved.
