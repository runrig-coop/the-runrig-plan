title: The Runrig Plan
subtitle: A socio-ecological methodology of software development
description: Free and open source software is a starting point, not the
    destination. Full computing autonomy requires control of the underlying
    infrastructure, something beyond the capacity of most individuals.
---

The Runrig Plan is a design methodology for communal software projects. It
emphasizes ecology and social relations rather than any particular technology
stack or software architecture. It was conceived specifically with food systems
and agricultural software in mind, but there's no reason it must be restricted
to that domain.

For now, the best overview is still the original [draft proposal]. The initial
goal was to adapt and expand that proposal into several ["appendices"] each
covering a broad subject matter, but that framework was poorly suited to the
material. In its place, the [Runrig Journal] will offer more organic, piecemeal
illustrations of Runrig's key components, which will then be outlined here and
organized by topic, with links to relevant articles that go into more detail.
Hopefully that will yield quicker entry points into the practical aspects of the
plan, while also giving a clearer birdseye view of the project in its totality.

## Why a New Methodology?
Generally speaking, the purpose of establishing the Runrig Plan as a distinct
methodology can be seen as threefold:

1. The Runrig Plan will form __a general critique of conventional software
   development methodologies__ – e.g., Agile or Lean development – and how they
   often come freighted with the implicit assumptions of proprietary technology
   and capitalistic modes of growth – e.g., concepts like scalability,
   Software-as-a-Service (SaaS, a.k.a., "the cloud"), and even object-oriented
   programming (OOP). The hope is to establish a new set of design primitives
   and computing metaphors that can help to counteract those anti-patterns and
   more fairly redistribute control over our shared technological inheritance.

2. In a similar vein, it will look at the ways __free & open source software
   ([FOSS]) can transcend the limited scope of _individual_ liberties to
   explicitly _socialize_ the project for software freedom__. This includes
   [radical participatory design] and can go so far as to blur the lines between
   the traditional realms of "user experience" (UX) and "developer experience"
   (DX). It requires leveraging the community's total knowledge and combined
   skills without privileging one form over another, because our collective
   expertise can be so much more powerful when it is based on mutual trust and a
   shared understanding. By designing for (and with) the [shared capabilities of
   the entire community], design decisions become better contextualized,
   information systems become more deeply integrated, and the tools we all use
   become more accessible to more people – or in other words, they become
   _[convivial tools]_.

3. Finally, through __analysis of Runrig's ongoing work and emerging project
   proposals__, the plan will address what concrete strategies have worked,
   which ones have not, and how to adapt those lessons to serve a broader
   community of farmers, food workers, and technologists. This will be in
   conjunction with – and mostly synthesized from – the [Runrig Journal], an
   ongoing series of blog posts, case studies, tutorials, etc. As much as
   possible, the plan is meant to be an iterative, living document that can
   incorporate an ever wider scope of perspectives. so if you have any
   questions, comments, or you'd like to contribute, please [email Jamie].

## Original Documents
The original plan and its appendices have been archived for reference:

- [The Runrig Plan]
- [Appendix: Ecology]
- [Appendix: Architecture]

Some material from "Ecology" and "Architecture" will incorporated into newer
articles, such as [Illegible Agriculture]. The archived documents will
eventually be superseded by those updated versions, but the original content
will be preserved and the links should remain stable.
