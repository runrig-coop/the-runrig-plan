# Get Involved
Runrig is seeking partnerships and collaborations with similarly aligned
organizations and soon hopes to begin recruiting farmers, activists, tech
workers and other individuals as coop members. If you'd like to discuss joining
Runrig or collaborating in some way, I'd love to hear from you! You can can
email me at [jamie@runrig.org]. Feel free to reach out on general inquiries or
feedback there, too, or sign up to the newsletter below for biweekly content and
updates on the project.

[jamie@runrig.org]: mailto:jamie@rurnig.org

## Newsletter
About every two weeks, I try to post a new article, technical report, or even
the occasional long-form essay to the [Runrig Journal]. These will cover topics
related to ethical software design, the politics of food and technology, and
general updates on the work I've been doing with Runrig. To get notified when
these are released, you can sign up for the newsletter using the form below, or
via [RSS Feed], [Atom], and [JSON Feed].

## Follow
You can also follow Runrig on Mastodon as [@runrig@social.coop] or on Bluesky as
[@runrig.bsky.social], where I'll try to post when the newsletter comes out,
when workshops are scheduled, or other events are planned.

## Chat
Whether you have general questions and suggestions, requests for mutual aid tech
support, or just want to chat with folks in the community, you can join the
Runrig [Matrix] room. Some of us can also be found on the Discourse forum run by
the Gathering for Open Agricultural Technology (GOAT).

## Open Design Workshops
The Open Design Workshops are the main venue where both the Runrig community and
its core technologies are being constructed. They are typically held on one or
two Fridays each month at 2pm US Eastern Time.
