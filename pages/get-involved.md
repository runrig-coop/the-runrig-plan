# Get Involved
Runrig is actively seeking partnerships and collaborations with similarly
aligned organizations, and very soon hope to begin recruiting farmers,
activists, tech workers and other individuals as coop members. At most once or
twice a month we will send out updates on those upcoming events and other
developments in the Runrig community. Sign up below if you wish to be notified
by email.

## Chat
Whether you have general questions and suggestions, requests for mutual aid tech
support, or just want to chat with folks in the community, you can join the
Runrig [Matrix] room. Some of us can also be found on the Discourse forum run by
the Gathering for Open Agricultural Technology (GOAT).

## Open Design Workshops
The Open Design Workshops are the main venue where both the Runrig community and
its core technologies are being constructed. They are typically held on one or
two Fridays each month at 2pm US Eastern Time.
