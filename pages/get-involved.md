# Get Involved
Central to Runrig's design methodology are the social relations and communities
that develop in tandem with the development of any particular technology.
Priority should be given to these relationships over all other performance
indicators or engagement metrics. We also seek to promote an open culture of
design, where knowledge is produced and shared in collaboration among
practitioners from every level and realm of expertise. Ideally, this should
include diverse members of the broader technological ecosystem, persons involved
at all stages of the supply chain, and the totality of subjects that make up a
given foodshed or bioregion, human and otherwise.

This is all part of the principle of ["ecology over architecture"], as outlined
in the Runrig Plan.

## Open Design Workshops
The Open Design Workshops are the main venue where both the Runrig community and
its core technologies are being constructed. They are held every other Friday at 2pm US Eastern Time.

## Other Events and Project Information
A more detailed view of the kinds of projects we're working on and where we're
heading can be found in the [Runrig Roadmap for 2024]. You can also checkout out
our GitHub [repositories] and [discussions] for the latest progress.

In the future we'd like to diversify the types of events we host. Some examples of the kinds of activities that could broaden the base of participants:

- Group learning and knowledge production, from the study groups, documentation
  efforts, cataloging and assessing existing tools, drafting standard operating
  procedures and other training materials, original research, experimentation
  and free play.
- Hands-on construction of practical tools, from software development, interface
  and experience design, to straight-up hacking on existing tools and workflows.
- Mapping out known problem spaces, identifying new projects and potential
  collaborators, and conducting technical interviews with domain experts.
- Co-authoring and revising the Runrig Plan as a set of shared principles and a
  distinct methodology, akin the [Agile Manifesto] or the [Toyota Production
  System], but in conscious opposition to the capitalistic assumptions
  underpinning those philosophies.

If any of that sounds interesting or you have other suggestions, feel free to
open a new thread in the GitHub [discussions] board.

With each Runrig project, we intend to provide users with carefully designed
tools that can help bridge existing software platforms to meet their specific
needs, while helping to improve the overall ecosystem of open technology. At the
same time, we strive to make each application more than just a proof-of-concept
or a prototype, but rather a targeted, production-ready intervention that
delivers immediate gains for farmers and other food workers working in the field
today.

To that end, we invite any and all farmers, designers, food workers, engineers,
students, activists, legal experts, policy wonks, fellow travelers and curious
onlookers to participate. Users and developers of other _libre_ software tools
are especially encouraged to join and let us know ways we can complement and
contribute to their projects.

## Newsletter
We're actively seeking partnerships and collaborations with similarly aligned
organizations, and very soon hope to begin recruiting farmers, activists, tech
workers and other individuals as coop members. At most once or twice a
month we will send out updates on those upcoming events and other developments
in the Runrig community. Sign up below if you wish to be notified by email.

## Chat
Whether you have general questions and suggestions, requests for mutual aid tech
support, or just want to chat with folks in the community, you can join the
Runrig [Matrix] room. Some of us can also be found on the
`#design-tech-incubator` channel on [Skywoman]'s Discord server and the
Discourse forum run by the Gathering for Open Agricultural Technology (GOAT).
