As a design methodology, the Runrig Plan prioritizes organic design elements
that can evolve and that are _necessarily_ enmeshed within a broader ecosystem
of digital and social technologies, the majority of which are outside the
designer's control. I've tried to distill this down to a simple maxim: _ecology
over architecture_. This is meant to inoculate against a tendency in software to
fixate on the latest "tech stack," whether that's blockchain, neural networks,
or whatever database happens to be the latest fad. I don't mean to eschew the
notion of architecture altogether; it just shouldn't represent a hard boundary,
demarcating the totality of the design space. Architecture must yield to the
greater ecology the system, which knows no bounds, and so become less
determinate, less mechanistic, more permeable. Good architecture must be able
and willing to float.

Federated municipal platforms are intended to be one such architectural pattern,
one that will play a central role in many of the systems I hope to build with
Runrig.
