title: Runrig in 2025
subtitle: An overdue recap.
author: Jamie Gaehring
description: Introducing the Runrig Journal, plus a recap of what's been going
    on with the project over the last year and a half.
---

It's been a while since I've posted a general update on Runrig. There are more
details below on what's been going on with the project lately, but I also want
to take this opportunity to address how I'll be shifting focus a bit going
forward.

In brief, I've updated the [Runrig Journal] to accommodate a more consistent
publication schedule for general articles, technical reports, and even the
occasional long-form essay. I'll be starting off on a biweekly schedule, posting
something new here on the website and sending it out in the [newsletter]. I've
also set up [RSS], [Atom] & [JSON] feeds you can subscribe to; I took an _ad
hoc_, "roll-your-own" approach to those feeds, so hopefully they all work!
&#x1F91E;&#x1F3FB;

As a sample of the kind of material I intend to publish in the future, you can
take a look at the essay I published last spring titled ["Hedgerows in the Sky"]
or the documents I'm in the process of releasing as part of an ongoing
consultation with the [Farm Flow] app created by Fitzgerald Organics.

## What's Been Going On
Eighteen months ago, I laid out a [rather elaborate roadmap] for what I saw as
the best path forward for Runrig in 2024. I felt it was time to narrow my focus
on creating reference implementations that would showcase some of the untried
strategies behind Runrig – to show rather than merely tell. This would be
_Phase-Zero_ in what I considered a [Three-Phase Organizing Model]. Though I
specifically did not intend to pursue sponsorships or funding for that work, I
saw it as the basis of an eventual business model for a tech-workers'
cooperative.

Of course, putting such meticulous care into any sort of plan practically
guarantees the universe will swat it down. That is more or less what happened
when I was asked to consult on [Farm Flow]. In many ways, it was the kind of
project I'd have loved to take on in _Phase Two_, where I envisioned Runrig
becoming a sort of "One-stop Platform Co-op Shop." By that I meant that we – and
by then, it would surely have to be "we" and not just "I" – could be hired by
farming communities or food cooperatives to setup service platforms customized
for their region, so they retained full ownership and control while paying a
small fee for managed hosting and light sysadmin work. Farm Flow wasn't a
perfect 1-to-1 match for that sort of platform, but the more I learned the more
I felt it could truly benefit by adapting some of those principles to its
development. It seemed like too good an opportunity to pass up, to put some
theory into practice and see how it measured up.

I've had the good fortune to participate in a few other projects and events over
the past year, each working to shape, challenge, and reconfigure my conception
of Runrig from what I first [sketched out] roughly two years ago. Part of my
intention with this reorganization of the website is to make [The Runrig Plan]
more of a "living document" once again by enabling a more flexible publication
format.

Around this time last spring, I was putting the finishing touches on a 6-month
labor of love, which I titled ["Hedgerows in the Sky"] and published quietly
here on the Runrig site, as well as on [_Commonplace_] in abridged form. What
started off as a belated reflection on the 2022 Gathering for Agricultural
Technology (GOAT) had snowballed into a longer rumination on the relationship
between agriculture and technology, enclosure and the commons, plus a bit of
18th century English folk poetry. You might call it an intellectual memoir of my
own haphazard education in political economy, exploring such unwieldy concepts
like _usufruct_ and _alienation_; then combine that with a little amateur
historiography, tracing the various ways _the commons_ – both as a metaphor and
as a practice – has shaped food and tech movements in North America since the
end of the Cold War. I kept meaning to send a short newsletter regarding the
essay, which never happened, but I was (and still am) quite pleased with how it
turned out.

Later in August 2024, I carried those same ideas to [DWeb Camp] in Navarro, CA,
taking the main themes from "Hedgerows" as the point of departure for a panel
discussion on appropriate technologies and non-extractive forms of sharing
knowledge. As someone who rarely travels beyond the Northeastern U.S., the
culture shock of Silicon Valley was acute, even in that remote park 2 hours
north of the Bay, surrounded by tall redwoods and crunchy decentralized
techno-hippies. But I mainly stuck to the "Cultivation Station," a square canopy
that housed no more tha 40 people and where the agenda centered on food,
ecology, free software, and tech justice. Under that tent in those short few
days, I was quite gratified to meet a brilliant cohort of engineers, designers,
and activists. Joining me on the panel were two familiar faces from my previous
work with OpenTEAM and farmOS, Dr. Ankita Raturi from Purdue University's
[Axilab] and Tibet Sprague from [Hylo]; there were also two new faces, Rudo
Kemper, Program Director for [Conservation Metrics] and Nadia Coelho Pontes,
Co-founder of [Tekopora] in Brazil, who I was very pleased to meet for the first
time on that panel. Really, everyone there was doing such phenomenal work; I
hope I have a chance to reconnect with them all again and perhaps write a bit
about their projects. There was also some vigorous debate around funding models
for free & open source software. I'm never short of opinions on that particular
subject, so in the weeks after the conference I was compelled to draw some
[comparisons between Runrig's approach and other proposed methods]; I want to
rework those slides, too, into something better suited for a general audience.

## On Deck
I'm still processing so much of what I've learned and experienced over the last
year, between Farm Flow, DWeb, my continuing involvement with GOAT and farmOS,
and so forth. Those experiences have certainly left their mark on how I think
about Runrig today and I've tried to express their implications in various
places. I've committed a great deal of space in my personal journal, but also
scattered about in various GitHub repositories, in emails with colleagues, in
shared documents and slide presentations. Much of that material material is now
enqueued for the Runrig Journal. As a little teaser, here's my working list
of provisional titles:

1. Runrig in 2025 [the present article]
2. Scaling & Abstraction
3. Three Layers of Autonomy
4. Federated Autonomous Municipal Platforms
5. Intro to [Runrig farmOS]
6. Surmounting Local Maxima in the Fitness Landscape
7. Data Independence
8. Illegible Agriculture

In addition, I'll be adding more information to the [Farm Flow] project profile
and creating similar profiles for [Runrig farmOS] and the [MAIA Project].
Further on the horizon I still intend to return to [parts 2 & 3 of "Hedgerows"]
and a couple more ambitious concepts I've been mulling on, like "The Semiotics
of Data" and "Socially Necessary Computation Time." So all you theory-nerds,
stay tuned!

## The Future of Runrig
In the course of developing these projects I've learned that perhaps the
greatest challenge to realizing Runrig's full potential may lie in communicating
its fundamental principles and methodology. From the very start, I've tried to
downplay Runrig as any particular technology stack or software application, and
instead emphasize the elements I hope can serve as a template for a very
different _mode of producing_ technology, regardless the final shape it takes.
In other words, Runrig is meant to be more of a _social technology_ than a
digital technology, and so more analogous to the way Free & Open Source Software
(FOSS) functions as a manner of developing, say, the Linux kernel, rather than
an analog to Linux itself. However, Runrig would go beyond free software
principles, which I still view to be positively essential to producing good,
ethical technology, but which I see as hampered by a narrowly liberal conception
of freedom that only considers the individual. Runrig would strive to
_socialize_ the project for software freedom. As a radical new design
methodology, you might compare Runrig to the Agile Manifesto or Lean Software
Development, but diametrically opposed to those paradigms' deeply embedded,
capitalistic assumptions about market-driven economics and infinite growth – or
what technologists are so fond of calling _scalability_. Runrig would instead be
an explicitly socialist methodology for distributing computational power,
control, and ownership based on communalist principles.

The establishment of such a practice cannot be achieved merely through the
implementation of one or another software program. As a social project, it first
requires a quorum of participants and consensus on a shared set of values, and
so those principles must be clearly stated, attested to, and argued for. I fully
intend to continue developing software libraries and applications as a central
part of this project, but I see their importance as secondary to the methods
used to produce them. For those methods to have any meaningful impact, they must
be communicated effectively, along with the rationale for employing them in the
first place. If Runrig endures long enough to leave any sort of legacy behind,
I'd like it to be the documentation of that methodology and the exposition of
those principles. That will be the primary task of the [Runrig Journal] in the
weeks ahead.

I still hope for Runrig to support a workers' cooperative in the future, too, so
I'm always eager to speak with any other designers, engineers, or food workers
who wish to contribute to the implementation and deployment of these kinds of
services. Nothing would make me happier than to earn my livelihood with
like-minded coworker-owners doing exactly that, maybe even something not too
dissimilar from the kind of [co-op I described in the roadmap] a year and a half
ago. At the same time, I've never assumed that it's Runrig's ultimate fate to
become a going concern. With that in mind, I will be looking for ways to put
Runrig into practice in my own community of New York City and the Hudson Valley
region, ideally through mutual aid projects that I can benefit from directly,
even if it's not in the form of a paycheck. So I doubly encourage anyone with an
interest who also lives in the area to reach out as well. Of course, if you're
someone who wants to support Runrig other ways, even if it's not as a dedicated
co-op member or as someone in the Northeastern U.S., I'm sure not going to turn
down help. And please forward this along to others who might like to get
involved. Once I get the details for [Runrig farmOS] organized on the site, I
may look into ways of enabling sponsorship of specific projects as some form of
crowdfunding initiative. In any event, if you've read this far and I've piqued
your interest somehow, then by all means, please, [don't be a stranger!]
