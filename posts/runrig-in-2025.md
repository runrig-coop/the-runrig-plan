title: Runrig in 2025
subtitle: An overdue recap.

description: What's been going on.

It's been a while since I've posted a general update on Runrig. There are more
details below on [what's been going on] with the project since then, but I also
want to take this opportunity to address how I'll be shifting focus a bit going
forward.

In brief, I've updated the [Runrig Journal] to accommodate a more consistent
publication schedule for general articles, technical reports, and even the
occasional long-form essay. I'll be starting off on a biweekly schedule, posting
something new here on the website and sending it out in the [newsletter]. I've
also set up an [RSS], [Atom] & [JSON] feeds you can subscribe to; I took an _ad
hoc_, "roll-your-own" approach to those feeds, so hopefully they all work!
&#x1F91E;&#x1F3FB;

As a sample of the kind of material I intend to publish in the future, you can
take a look at the essay I published last spring titled ["Hedgerows in the Sky"]
or the documents I've released as part of an ongoing consultation with the [Farm
Flow] app created by Fitzgerald Organics.

I've realized through the course of these projects that the main work of
bringing Runrig into fruition is in the communication of its underlying
principles and methodology. From the very start, I've tried to downplay Runrig
as any particular technology stack or software design, and instead emphasize the
elements I hope can serve as a template for a very different _mode of producing_
technology, whatever shape it takes. In other words, Runrig is meant to be more
of a _social technology_ than an information technology, and so more analogous
to the way Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) functions as a manner of
developing, say, the Linux kernel, rather than an analog to the Linux itself.
However, Runrig would go beyond free software principles, which I still view to
be positively essential to producing good, ethical technology, but which I see
as hampered by a narrowly liberal conception of freedom that only considers the
individual. Runrig would strive to _socialize_ the project for software freedom.
As a radical new design methodology, you might compare Runrig to the Agile
Manifesto or Lean Software Development, but diametrically opposed to those
paradigms' deeply embedded, capitalistic assumptions about market-driven
economics and infinite growth – or what technologists are so fond of calling
_scalability_. Runrig would instead be a socialist methodology for distributing
computational power, control, and ownership based on communalist principles.

The establishment of such a practice cannot be achieved merely by the
implementation of one or another software program. As a social project, a
consensus or quorum of participants is required first, and so those principles
must be stated, documented, and argued for. I fully intend to continue
developing software libraries and applications as a central part of this
project, but I see their importance as secondary to the methods used to produce
them. For those methods to have any meaningful impact, they must be communicated
effectively, along with the rationale for employing them. If Runrig leaves any
sort of legacy behind it, however long it endures, I hope it lies there, in the
documentation of that methodology and the exposition of its principles. That
will be the primary task of the [Runrig Journal] in the weeks ahead.

## What's Been Going On
Eighteen months ago, I laid out a [rather elaborate roadmap] for what I saw as
the best path forward for Runrig in 2024. I felt it was time to narrow my focus
on creating reference implementations that would showcase some of the untried
strategies behind Runrig – to show rather than merely tell. This would be
_Phase-Zero_ in what I considered a [Three-Phase Organizing Model]. Though I
specifically did not intend to pursue sponsorships or funding for that work, I
saw it as the basis of an eventual business model for a tech-workers'
cooperative.

Of course, putting such meticulous care into any sort of plan practically
guarantees the universe will swat it down. That is more or less what happened
when I was asked to consult on [Farm Flow]. In many ways, it was the kind of
project I'd have loved to take on in _Phase Two_, where I envisioned Runrig
becoming a sort of "One-stop Platform Co-op Shop." By that I meant that we – and
by then, it would surely have to be "we" and not just "I" – could be hired by
food/farm communities to setup service platforms customized for their region, so
they retained full ownership and control while paying a small fee for managed
hosting and light sysadmin work. Farm Flow wasn't a perfect 1-to-1 match for
that sort of platform, but the more I learned the more I felt it could truly
benefit by adapting some of those principles to its development. It seemed like
too good an opportunity to pass up, to put some theory into practice and see how
it measured up.

I've had the good fortune to participate in a few other projects and events over
the past year, each working to shape, challenge, and reconfigure my conception
of Runrig from what I first [sketched out] roughly two years ago.

Around this time last spring, I was putting the finishing touches on a 6-month
labor of love, which I titled ["Hedgerows in the Sky"] and published quietly
here on the Runrig site, as well as on [_Commonplace_] in abridged form. What
started off as a belated reflection on the 2022 Gathering for Agricultural
Technology (GOAT) had snowballed into a longer rumination on the relationship
between agriculture and technology, enclosure and the commons, plus a bit of
18th century English folk poetry. You might call it an intellectual memoir of my
own haphazard education in political economy, exploring such unwieldy concepts
like _usufruct_ and _alienation_; then combine that with a little amateur
historiography, tracing the various ways _the commons_ – both as a metaphor and
as a practice – has shaped food and tech movements in North America since the
end of the Cold War. I kept meaning to send a short newsletter regarding the
essay, which never happened, but I was (and still am) quite pleased with how it
turned out.

Later in August 2024, I carried those same ideas to [DWeb Camp] in Navarro, CA,
taking the main themes from "Hedgerows" as the point of departure for a panel
discussion on appropriate technologies and non-extractive forms of sharing
knowledge. As someone who rarely travels beyond the Northeastern U.S., the
culture shock of Silicon Valley was acute, even in that remote park 2 hours
north of the Bay, surrounded by tall redwoods and crunchy decentralized
techno-hippies. But I mainly stuck to the "Cultivation Station," a square canopy
that housed no more tha 40 people and where the agenda centered on food,
ecology, free software, and tech justice. Under that tent in those short few
days, I was quite gratified to meet a brilliant cohort of engineers, designers,
and activists. Joining me on the panel were two familiar faces from my previous
work with OpenTEAM and farmOS, Dr. Ankita Raturi from Purdue University's
[Axilab] and Tibet Sprague from [Hylo]; there were also two new faces, Rudo
Kemper, Program Director for [Conservation Metrics] and Nadia Coelho Pontes,
Co-founder of [Tekopora] in Brazil, who I was very pleased to meet for the first
time on that panel. Really, everyone there was doing such phenomenal work; I
hope I have a chance to reconnect with them all again and perhaps write a bit
about their projects. There was also some vigorous debate around funding models
for free & open source software. I'm never short of opinions on that particular
subject, so in the weeks after the conference I was compelled to draw some
[comparisons between Runrig's approach and other proposed methods]; I hope to
rework those slides, too, into something better suited for a general audience.

## On Deck
I'm still processing so much of what I've learned and experienced over the last
year, between Farm Flow, DWeb, my continuing involvement with GOAT and farmOS,
and so forth. Those experiences have certainly left their mark on how I think
about Runrig today and I've tried to express their implications in various
places. I've committed a great deal of space in my personal journal, but also
scattered about in various GitHub repositories, in emails with colleagues, in
shared documents and slide presentations. Much of that material material is now
enqueued for the Runrig Journal. As a little teaser, I'll share my working list
of provisional titles:

1. Runrig in 2025 [the present article]
2. Scaling & Abstraction
3. Three Layers of Autonomy
4. Federated Autonomous Municipal Platforms
5. Intro to [Runrig farmOS]
6. Surmounting Local Maxima in the Fitness Landscape
7. Data Independence
8. Illegible Agriculture

In addition, I'll be adding more information to the [Farm Flow] project profile
and creating similar profiles for [Runrig farmOS] and the [MAIA Project].
