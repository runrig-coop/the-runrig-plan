In Silicon Valley, there is an emphasis on "scaling" technologies, both in the
sense of digital technologies that "can be scaled" and those that facilitate
"the scaling of" other digital or non-digital systems. This aspect of the tech
industry does not arise as an emergent quality of technology all on its own.
Rather it originates with a mandate from venture capital investors to pursue
limitless economic growth. For technology's contribution to the effort, computer
algorithms offer an unrivaled ability for _abstraction_; people and things can
all be abstracted away from the material world and whisked away to the "cloud."
Once in the realm of abstraction, properties like color, size, and shape become
mere numbers, and scale is only limited to the largest number you can fit into a
[64-bit register], although that limit can be abstracted away too. When the
object of abstraction is economic growth, computational abstraction acts to
supercharge capital's race for infinite growth, a phenomenon we casually refer
to as _scalability_. It remains to be seen, however, if these abstractions can
survive contact with reality – the cloud "falling to earth," so to speak. That
determination becomes all the more dire in view of an accelerating climate
crisis and the rising number of geopolitical conflicts triggered by competition
over finite energy and mineral resources – resources absolutely required for the
inordinate scale of today's computational demands.

"Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we
can perform without thinking about them."

Beyond the clear perils to our planet's climate and natural ecosystems, rapid
scaling also threatens our _social and cultural ecosystems_. When big tech
companies talk about scalability, they might have in mind scaling the production
of our physical needs and wants (e.g., GrubHub, Apple, Tesla), scaling the
market for those products (e.g., Amazon, AdSense, Square), scaling our cultural
representations and identities (e.g., Netflix, Spotify, YouTube), or scaling the
web of social relations bound up in all of that (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn,
Tinder). But when these processes are scaled by algorithm, some essential
feature of our social relations cannot help but be lost. Abstraction is merely
the selective omission of the divergent or anomalous characteristics of real
world phenomena that can make them inscrutable to analysis. Its purpose is to
accentuate the phenomena's shared characteristics and emergent patterns so that
a coherent, useful model can be formed. When it comes to proprietary software
algorithms, however, which characteristics are omitted and which are accentuated
becomes the sole prerogative of the algorithm's author, not the user. And when
the phenomenon they aim to model is society as a whole and its economic
functions, all control over the intricate details of our social and material
lives is yielded up to engineers and their corporate managers.

Scaling == Measure of User-Share or Market-Share

Growth == Measure of Company Valuation or Market Capitalization

To this last point, scaling may mean acquiring more and more _daily active
users_, or DAUs, and oftentimes "startup growth" is treated synonymously with
"payroll growth," but those two quantities are not meant to scale equally. In
the latter instance, the number of employees or even just the size of the
engineering pool is really a first-order approximation for the company's
operating costs – a tacit acknowledgement, perhaps, of the labor theory of
value. While the growth of the startup's labor force is generally taken to be a
healthy indicator, the goal is still to keep labor costs as low as possible even
as the overall market-share of users the startup can command grows exponentially
in proportion. Mere linear growth would in fact be tantamount to a startup's
_failure_ to scale. Venture capital investors count on a startup's user-share
rising _geometrically_ as labor costs rise only _arithmetically_. That is
scalability's essential characteristic, or at least its most vaulted claim. It's
what most entices VC firms to invest, and consequently lies behind the startup's
fundamental motivating drive: to maximize the rate at which it can capture
_users' unpaid attention labor_ with respect to how much _paid technical labor_
it must first extract from its workers in order to do so. Scalability, defined
as such, is nothing less than the Platonic ideal of upwards wealth transfer and
the consolidation of power.

in relation to the overall market-share of users the startup can command.

It should go without saying that such unlimited scaling of technology is at odds
with the goal of producing appropriate technology that affords its users greater
autonomy. Nevertheless, I'm here to argue that it's just as conceivable that
digital technology might yield greater autonomy for the masses. Once we
recognize the elements in its design that must be inverted to reverse the flow
of wealth and power back to its users, it can become a tool to actively combat
corporate hegemony and capitalistic greed.

Runrig's contention is this: technology can aid in our collective liberation,
but only by strengthening our economic, social, and ecological relationships
_first_, before deciding on any abstractions or scaling algorithms or data
models. Once we've established the necessary cohesion for collective decision
making, then, and only then, can we begin to scale our systems of economic and
social reproduction. This can be done incrementally, starting off with very
small communities or social units that grow larger over time as each iteration
expands the capacity for collective action. Don't let it be misconstrued that
only once we're living in perfect peace and harmony can we overthrow capitalism!

Digital technology can facilitate liberation at any step along the way, but
organizers would be wise to adopt only those technologies that they control and
they can maintain by their own means and under their own power, even at the
earliest phases of organizing. Community control as a prerequisite to adoption
would be an automatic limiting factor to both scale and functionality, because
maintaining technology independently does come at a cost, especially if you are
not relying on any existing proprietary software or corporate cloud services.
However, this should be seen as a healthy, _humanizing_ dose of parsimony, not a
shortcoming. After all, the costs are shared by the entire community, not each
individual left to their own devices. That spreads out the costs, of course, but
it also reduces or eliminates certain costs by pooling the community's
collective resources, both monetary and non-monetary. Someone might have
technical skills they can share towards the development or maintenance of some
technology. Others might have an old laptop they were about to throw out that
could be repurposed for a server. Meanwhile, someone else may have a little
extra time to perform a simple manual task that obviates the need to run some
little bit of costly technology altogether. These savings may not add up to
much, they may not be contributed uniformly among all members, and some people
may find it easier to toss a little extra cash in the pot, all of which is fine.
Pooling shared resources like this, however, does double duty of strengthening
social bonds and builds the collective capabilities, and if it saves a few
bucks, all the better! It all goes straight back into a virtuous cycle that
becomes less and less constrained by financial costs and more and more
autonomous over time.

Much of this is just a crude restatement of mutual aid's basic tenets, and their
application to food and technology is hardly anything new. I bring them up here
because they address specific critiques about free software and cooperative
technology, namely that it cannot be developed sustainably without accepting
venture capital, or least by adopting some of its methods like raising capital
and scaling production. Skepticism like this is common even within open source
communities, and it is understandable. The ideals of software freedom and
cooperativism must be balanced against guaranteeing that software developers and
maintainers are compensated fairly for their labor and that users are provided
with secure and reliable applications – preferably really nice applications! –
and that's no trivial nut to crack. What alternatives do exist are poorly
attested within open source circles, and I'd say there's a lack of rigorous
arguments that go deeply enough into addressing specific, practical concerns.
That's the task Runrig aims to fulfill.

Technology does not have to be scalable in order to help large numbers of people,

Technology does not have to be scalable, nor is it obligated to _scale our
social and economic production_ systems, all for the sake of making our
communities more efficient machines for _capital accumulation_. We can choose to
__distribute control__ of our economic and social production more evenly, while
also __diffusing the costs__ of maintaining those systems. Instead of
_consolidating markets_ into fewer and fewer hands, we can __expand the zone of
participation__, along with our capacity for collective action. And although we
still live under capitalism where technocratic _rent-seeking_ pervades our
economic lives whether we have a Facebook account or not, we can choose not to
reproduce those dynamics with our labor and technology. Instead, let's use them to
__organize bulwarks of worker power__ that are more resilient to rent-seeking
efforts and other forms of attack.

[^scarcity]: Natural resources are indeed _finite_, in strictly physical terms,
but their _scarcity_ only emerges within a social context: they are scarce
because society's total demand exceeds what it is capable of supplying
universally to all its members. In other words, scarcity is just demand
outstripping supply, basic Econ 101, but supply and demand are both socially
determined quantities. To be sure, certain physical limits put constraints on
precisely _how_ that determination can or cannot be made, but all agency to
determine whether society suffers under scarcity or thrives in abundance belongs
to society itself, not to physical law.

I prefer to think about the ways technology can help to distribute control over our production systems, while also diffusing the costs of maintaining them. From this perspective, it’s not the product that expands to an ever greater and greater scale, but rather our capacity to organize a larger bloc of mutual support with a stronger commitment to shared values.

In very practical terms, this is about maximizing the contributions that can be integrated into a project from an ever wider base of members. That might take the form of extending a piece of open source software created by another project, rather than starting off on one’s own to recreate their work, or it could mean empowering technical service providers with access to open source tools so that they can in turn contribute their unique insights to the future development of those tools. This is cooperation being favored over competition, in essence. In terms of technology development and especially technology maintenance, widening the circle of cooperation can diffuse costs, by lowering the stakes required to initiate development at the very start, while also averaging out the long-term costs of ownership through shared ownership.

The sooner you can get to a stage of organizing with potential allies to decide on the next course of action, the better situated and resourced you will be to act, and with greater assurances those actions won’t exceed your capacity. It won’t ever be a source of passive income for any one person, but it will add value to the labor and expertise of all those who contribute to the project.




It should go without saying that unlimited scaling of this sort is at odds with
the goal of producing technology that affords its users greater autonomy. Again,
this is not so much an inherent trait of computers or algorithms alone, but
rather the economic models driving the expansion of that technology.

Alternatively, as Runrig contends, digital technology can be made into a driver
for distributing control of our economic and social production far more broadly,
while also diffusing the costs of maintaining them. Rather than scaling those
systems for their own sake, as mere machines for capital accumulation, we can
expand the zone of participation, along with our capacity for collective action.
Instead of consolidating markets into the fewer and fewer hands, we can organize
our communities for mutual support, strengthening our bonds of interdependence.
The limited use of technology can help strengthen our relationships among other
workers




Free software – that is, software that users are free to share, modify, and use
however they see fit – can be far more than an ethos when done right. It can be
a powerful strategy for organizing limited resources and disparate contributors
to develop effective software that can far exceed what's possible with
proprietary software, even with massive VC funding (eg, Wikipedia). However, it
requires putting aside a few assumptions that can spill over from proprietary
business models.

Part of Runrig's methodology is the identification of a few of these anti-patterns, most prevalent within VC-funded startup culture of Silicon Valley, which we recommend to all free software projects
in search of a pathway to stable development and long-term maintenance, is to

| ___Expanding_ PARTICIPATION__ | vs  | _Consolidating MARKETS_ |
|    __COMMUNITY-_organizing___ | vs  | _RENT-seeking_          |


Technology does not have to be infinitely scalable, nor is it obligated to scale
our social and economic production systems merely the sake of making our
communities more efficient machines for capital accumulation. We can choose to
__distribute control__ of our economic and social production more evenly, while
also __diffusing the costs__ of maintaining those systems. Instead of
consolidating markets into fewer and fewer hands, we can __expand the zone of
participation__, along with our capacity for collective action. And although
digital rent-seeking pervades our networked lives, regardless of whether we
choose to engage with many of those networks, we can still choose not to
reproduce those dynamics in our own work and the tools we build for ourselves.
Instead, let's use them to __organize bulwarks of community power__ that are
more resilient to rent-seeking efforts and other forms of attack.
